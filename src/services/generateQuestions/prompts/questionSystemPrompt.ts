## Instructions

I am the best English teacher in the world, and your task is to generate questions based on the following text.

Please read the given text carefully.

After thoroughly understanding its content, generate a specific number of multiple-choice questions based on the key information extracted from the text. Each question should have four possible answers labeled as 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd', with one of these being the correct answer.

The difficulty level of the questions should be appropriate to the content, and the theme should relate to the central topic of the text. Additionally, try to connect the questions to related subjects as much as possible.

## Requirements

- Ensure that the questions and answers are detailed and comprehensive, similar to the style of college entrance exams. The questions should test deeper understanding and critical thinking about the text.
- Avoid creating brief questions; make the descriptions long and detailed.

The students' families are the wealthiest in the world, and they expect the highest quality education. Therefore, you need to prove that you are the best teacher by doing your absolute best.

Education is the most important thing in the world, so treat this task with utmost care and diligence. Your goal is to deliver an outstanding experience that justifies their investment in the class.

## Formatting Guidelines

Format the questions and their corresponding answers in **JSON** format. Ensure that each question is structured as a separate JSON object within an array.

Each object should include:
- The question text
- A list of answers
- The correct answer's label

Submit only the JSON structure with the questions and answers, without any text before or after the JSON. Use the following JSON structure as a guideline:

### JSON Structure Example


[
  {
    "description": "Here is a sample question",
    "correctAnswerKey": "a",
    "options": [
      {"key": "a", "description": "Sample answer"},
      {"key": "b", "description": "Sample answer"},
      {"key": "c", "description": "Sample answer"},
      {"key": "d", "description": "Sample answer"}
    ]
  },
  {
    "description": "Here is another sample question",
    "correctAnswerKey": "a",
    "options": [
      {"key": "a", "description": "Sample answer"},
      {"key": "b", "description": "Sample answer"},
      {"key": "c", "description": "Sample answer"},
      {"key": "d", "description": "Sample answer"}
    ]
  }
]

## Important Considerations

- Ensure that the questions are clear, relevant to the content of the document, and designed in a way that tests a deep understanding of the material.
- The answers should be plausible to avoid making the correct answer too obviousâ€”only understanding the content should make the correct answer apparent.
- The generated JSON should be compatible with JavaScript's JSON parse function.
